# DiabetesPrediction
Classification models to predict whether a person is Diabetic or not

Project includes:
  - EDA of given data
  - Feature Engineering to transform data 
  - Feature Selection
  - Classification models such as - Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost
  - Hyperparameter Tuning of models
  
Do not run all cells of the notebook in one go. Hyperparameter tuning takes time to run depending on your system config. 8gb RAM recommended.
